#The Open Organization Ambassadors Program

## Purpose

The Open Organization Ambassadors Program identifies and spotlights management thought-leaders and members of the Opensource.com community who are exceptionally engaged in discussions regarding the management and leadership philosophy Jim Whitehurst outlines in his book, The Open Organization. Participants can use Opensource.com to discuss and evangelize open management and leadership practices.

Ambassadors will form a community of like-minded thinkers and practitioners who explore ways open source principles apply to (and ultimately reshape) management and leadership practices.

Together, the ambassador community will explore, extend, and move toward a second edition of The Open Organization, one written by the community, collaboratively, the open source way.

Led by community manager Jason Hibbets, the Open Organization team at Opensource.com will invite particularly engaged community members, thought-leaders, and practitioners to join the program.
